## ideas of the day

- I didn't code today, but did some studying in ML area. This is good, because it helps me to slow down and spend more time on problems before coming up with an answer. In the world of fast paced artificial or self-imposed unwarranted dead-lines coming up with quick answers becomes a bad habit.
- The good thing is, bad habits can be broken down, one bit at a time. 
- I'm looking forward to apply what I'm learning in something interesting.
