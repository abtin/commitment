## ideas of the day

- So I needed a Cloud run function to react both to web requests and pubsub requests. The simplest way for my usecase bacame a code with two end-points. One for synchronous request/reply and the other one for asynchronous pub/sub which reads on topic1 and write on topic2.

- I can write a sample code to demo that later, because the actual code for what I did is in a private repo for a client :(
