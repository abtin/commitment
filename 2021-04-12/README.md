## ideas of the day

- It's easy to make things unnecessarily complicated when we don't know simpler ways of doing them. It's important to simplify them after we found a better way though. Also, this is still valid:
  - Make it work, Make it right, Make it fast. 



## What blew my mind today

We can lose the battle of life like dinosaurs:

- Find some safe job (<u>getting hired)</u>,
- Which bring repeatability (<u>Salary)</u>,
- Which allow us to become so good at what we do (<u>Seniority)</u>,
- Which makes us to repeat our success frequently (<u>Professional)</u>,
- And habits takes form literally by repeating things and getting the expected result (<u>success on auto-pilot)</u>,
- And our mind is nothing but mostly repeating habits (<u>How brain works)</u>,
- Which forms our identity (<u>How we regard and reward ourselves)</u>,
- Which makes it harder for us to question it (<u>Loosing the feeling of security)</u>,
- And successful habits fall apart upon arrival of a black swan event (<u>or worse, nothing happens till we die</u>).



Do we need flexibility over consistency to succeed in life?
