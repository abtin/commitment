## ideas of the day

- I'd like to develop an extension for Brave/Chrome to allow me to flip a switch to turn it into dark mode.

  There are extensions doing that but

  1) Some of them are paid or freemium

  2) I get a warning that they can read my data on all page!

  Later on I hope I can make it depend on the time and accept a range for witch it will be in dark mode.

  I'm hoping to be able to flip the internal flags the browser, otherwise I'll have to research how else this can be done.
