## ideas of the day

- My original idea of this repo was to keep some of the codes I've done under each day's folder. However, that was not an optimum way and I kept the codes under their own repositories.
- It's challenging for people like me who don't work on open-source projects to share their work. Most of what I have done are protected by lots of NDAs and other corporate stuffs. But I'm going to keep this going to have a place to commit codes publicly. I would change the format from next month though.
