## Ideas of the day:
- I need a cli app to allow me to switch between my different github users easily.
	second thought:
		I can set user.name and user.email per git repo to ovverride the global config values
- I also like to see my current git user in zsh git.
	second thought:
		I can use git_current_user_email and git_current_user_name in zsh
